# Tribute Page for Muhammad Ali

*I chose to do a tribute page for my freecodecamp project based on Muhammad Ali. He was a great man who made history multiple times both in his professional boxing career and his personal life. He stood up for his beliefs as a conscious objector and civil rights activist.*
